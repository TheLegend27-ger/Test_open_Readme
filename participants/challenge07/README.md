Now we want to make our application available to others, by deploying it to the cloud. To get more familiar with the process lets do it manually first.

### Tasks

In this challenge, we will deploy to Azure Container Instances using docker compose.

1. Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-multi-container) to deploy our application to Azure App Services

2. Use the provided docker-compose.webapp.yml file and update the "myregistry" entries.

3. Start up your application and access it via its public IP adress

4. Document your commands

Bonus:

5. Move Database out of the application lifecycle by using Azure Cosmos DB

### Checklist
